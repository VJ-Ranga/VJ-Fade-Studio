# VJ Fade Studio

VJ Fade Studio is a lightweight, client-side tool to create WooCommerce-style hero images with smooth fades.

I built this for fun because I had to make a lot of banner and hero visuals for product pages. It helped my workflow, so I am sharing it publicly as a fully open-source project.
